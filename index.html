        <h2>My Discrete Math Experience</h2>
        <p>October 1, 2022 by Ashleigh Palmer</p>
        <p>When I heard I'd be doing something called "Discrete Mathematics, my first thought was "yikes, that sounds hard". Now I am sitting here today looking at all my hard work so far and I can honestly say, I was right!!! It's still hard. Nothing has chnaged so if you thought I was going to tell you about how much I've learnt from my experience so far and how much I love the subject then you are terribly mistaken. What was funny to me was when my lecturer said for the first offical class, we'd be going over simple things we learnt from our first year. I was so relieved, but when he started teaching it was a beautiful sight to see half the class lost and clueless about what he was teaching. Sure we learnt the topics he was discussing but not in great depth, so right off the bat I could tell that this course and I were not going to become friends. </p>
        <p>Fast forward a few classes later, I'm still not where I want to be but I admire my determination and my will to succeed. Mainly because I'd love that degree but still, there are totally other reasons why I'm trying in this class and I can give you three reasons : My Degree, my dEEgree and my DEGREE :). Did you really think I'd say anything different?

        <h2>My Net-Centric Computing Experience</h2>
        <p> October 1, 2022 by Ashleigh Palmer</p>
        <p>Lets talk about Net-Centric. You're probably thinking "what complaint is she coming with now?" And you are absolutely right. Its not long and confusing lectures, its not the knowledge check quizzes, it's not the constant emails from my lecturer posting more quizzes, its not the weekly mandatory quizzes, its not me having my lecturer as my tutor. You picking up what I'm saying yet? Yes. I'm drowning. But!! I'm persevering. Can you guess why? If you said for my degree, I like you, you're keeping up. Yes my friends, my degree truly matters to me. Its my fault for thinking that I was finished I was done with math and now I could just focus on being that cool coder who everybody looked up to when in reality all I'm doing is googling how to code a loop, but they don't know that. </p>
        <p> I can honestly say I'm catching up in Net-centric just a little bit, but I think he should maybe declutter the course page and take away the unnecessary quizzes.</p>
